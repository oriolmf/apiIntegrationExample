# API Integration Example: Swagger Documentation and Workflow

This repository serves as a comprehensive example for documenting and integrating two APIs using Swagger. It is designed to guide both end-users and developers through the process of understanding and implementing seamless communication between the APIs.

## Features
- **Swagger Documentation**
  - Interactive Swagger UI for exploring endpoints of both APIs.
  - Detailed descriptions of request/response formats, authentication methods, and error codes.
- **Integration Workflow**
  - A step-by-step guide illustrating how data flows between the two APIs.
  - Use-case scenarios such as user authentication, data synchronization, and webhook handling.
- **Code Examples**
  - Sample scripts (in Python, Node.js, or another language) demonstrating how to consume the APIs.
  - Integration templates to jumpstart development.

## Structure
1. **docs/**: Contains Swagger JSON/YAML definitions and Markdown files with API details.
2. **examples/**: Ready-to-run code snippets for various integration use cases.
3. **workflow/**: Visual diagrams and README files explaining data flow and error handling strategies.

## Getting Started
